## Description

https://shielded-earth-13185.herokuapp.com/#/home

I’ve always been interested in changing some behaviors in my day to day life to improve my physical, mental, and emotional health. After many attempts with varying degrees of success, I’ve always found that one of the largest barriers I face is my limited bandwidth to focus on all of the priorities in my daily life. As my focus eventually drifts away from the change I’m attempting to make, that habit falls by the wayside. 

I made “Path Track” to help address this barrier. Path Track allows users to create new habits in the app, giving them a place to log their day to day progress. Users can journal their thoughts and feelings, while also being able to document the obstacles and the effects they are experiencing. Additionally Path Track gives users a place to reflect on their motivations, as well as the things in their lives they are thankful for. The importance of reflecting on these motivations and blessings is that it’s not only important to maintain focus, but also to maintain a positive mindset.
